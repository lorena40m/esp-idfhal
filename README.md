# An embedded-hal implementation for Rust on ESP32 and ESP-IDF

* This crate is intended for usage in ESP32 embedded projects that utilize and link with the **ESP-IDF SDK**.
* For embedded projects that don't need Rust STD support, WiFi or BLE (and thus don't link with the ESP-IDF SDK), please check [esp32-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp32-hal).

For more information, check out:
